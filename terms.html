                                in third-party testimonials do not guarantee income or performance outcomes from the

                                <br>8.1 The Company reserves the right to amend these Terms at its sole discretion
                                without prior notice or liability to you. You agree to be bound by these amended Terms.
                                Please review the most recent version of the Terms periodically to stay informed of any
                                updates. Your continued use of the Online Services or Materials after any modifications
                                will signify your acceptance of the changes.
                                <br>8.2 Charges and Payment Terms may be adjusted according to the applicable price
                                schedule; all other provisions may be amended immediately by the Company. If you find
                                any changes unacceptable, your access to the Online Services may be terminated
                                immediately upon notice. Continuing to use the Online Services following any changes
                                signifies your acceptance of those changes.
                                <br>8.3 The Company reserves the right to terminate your access to the Online Services.
                                Termination will take effect ten (10) days after you receive a notice of termination
                                unless a later date is specified. The Company may suspend or discontinue providing the
                                Online Services to you without notice and pursue any other legally available remedies if
                                you fail to comply with any obligations under this Agreement.

                                <br>8.6 If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid, illegal, or unenforceable
                                for any reason, the remaining provisions will continue to be in full force, and the
                                Agreement shall be interpreted as if the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision
                                were not included.
                                <br>8.7 You may not assign your rights or delegate your obligations under this Agreement
                                without the prior written consent of the Company.
