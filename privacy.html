                                it. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle and protect any personal information you
                                may provide to us, ensuring that your data is treated with the highest level of
                                confidentiality and care.
                            </p>
                            <p>This Privacy Policy applies specifically to this website, which is operated by Bizz
                                Survey (“we”). It is important to note that this policy pertains solely to the
                                information collected through this site and does not extend to other websites maintained
                                by third parties that may be linked from our site.</p>

                            <p><b>Information We Collect and How We Use It.</b><br>We collect and use personal
                                information from you primarily to respond to your requests for products and services
                                available through the Site. For instance, when you seek quotes for insurance products,
                                we may ask you to provide your full name, address, telephone number, email, and other
                                relevant details. This information helps us match you with carriers and agents who can
                                offer you appropriate services and quotes. Additionally, we collect demographic
                                information, which includes data like gender and zip code that is not directly linked to
                                your personal identity. Occasionally, we may receive additional information about you
                                from online or offline sources, and this data may be added to your existing account to
                                enhance our services.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>Sharing and Disclosure of Information.</b><br>We may share your personal information
                                under certain circumstances. If you submit a request for quotes through the Site, the
                                information you provide (such as your name, address, and contact details) may be shared
                                with third parties, including agents, carriers, lead aggregators, and other service
                                providers within our network, to process your request. In some cases, we might also
                                obtain additional information about you, such as your Social Security Number or credit
                                report, to better match you with suitable Service Providers. Rest assured, all Service
                                Providers in our network are bound by agreements to comply with federal and state
                                privacy regulations. By submitting your information to us, you acknowledge that these
                                Service Providers may contact you through various means (including phone, email, SMS, or
                                mail) to fulfill your request, even if you are on the National Do Not Call List. If you
                                wish not to be contacted by a particular Service Provider after your initial inquiry,
                                you should directly request that the provider refrain from further contact.

                                identify you with third parties, including affiliates, for purposes such as developing
                                and delivering targeted advertising on our Site or third-party websites. This type of
                                data is used to understand trends and preferences without revealing individual
                                identities.</p>


                            <p><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b><br>In certain situations, we may be required to
                                share your personal information with law enforcement or government agencies in response
                                to subpoenas, court orders, or audits. We may also share information if it is necessary
                                to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,
                                or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, or as otherwise
                                required by law.</p>

                                </b><br>As our business evolves, there may be instances where we merge with or are

                                have access to the information maintained by us, including your personal data. However,
                                the new company would remain bound by this Privacy Policy unless you consent to a new
                                one.</p>
